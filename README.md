New CDK for Audioniek's Duckbox Development Toolchain

MPORTANT NOTICE:

As of October 1st, 2017 this git will no longer be maintained in favour of the buildsystem-git.

This git will eventually disappear in the first quarter of 2018. If you want to continue using this git, either fork it or use a copy for your own use locally.

The reason for this is that maintaining three git's for the same purpose is a bit too much for a single person.

Thank you for understanding.
